# personStatus

* I have a basic react app to display one person’s worth of information.
* I iterate over an array of people’s basic information. 
* While keeping the new list of contacts in the top-level of state.
* I added a pending and a done status.
* Green means the status is done. 
* Orange mean status still pending.
